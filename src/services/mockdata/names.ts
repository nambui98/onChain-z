      'Pronounced ZYE-on, this is a unisex name of Hebrew origin that’s mostly chosen for boys. A zion was a citadel that was in the center of Jerusalem, which explains why it means “highest point.” Today it’s known as the biblical term for the Promised Land; Zionism refers to the movement to establish a Jewish homeland. To Rastafarians, a religious group in Jamaica, the name means "utopia." When singer Lauryn Hill and Rohan Marley, son of reggae superstar Bob Marley, called their son Zion in 1997, the name became an instant hit.
