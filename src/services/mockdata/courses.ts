    description: `Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-inspired universe where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Players can battle, collect, raise, and build a land-based kingdom for their pets.Its core gameplay draws heavily from Pokémon: you have a team of 3 creatures called Axies with various skills, which you battle with, against either computer-controlled opponents or other real-life players.
    Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based game with a few twists and adjustments inspired by the massively popular Pokémon game series. Breeding, raising, and battling cute creatures is the focus of Axie Infinity. It’s a great example of how the gaming and cryptocurrency worlds can coexist.`,
